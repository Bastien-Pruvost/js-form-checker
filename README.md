# Form checker (validation)

A form checker coded in JS

[form-checker.pruvostbastien.fr](https://form-checker.pruvostbastien.fr)


## About the project

I made this project to practice JavaScript. It's a pretty simple form with validation.

I added an indication bar for the security of the password according to the characters used in the password (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).

I know it could have been done quickly with a library but I purposely didn't use one.

The script checks that the nickname is between 3 and 20 characters, that the email is in the correct format and that the passwords match.


## Features

- Form validation
- Password strength indicator
